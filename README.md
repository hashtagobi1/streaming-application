# Info

	- Video is pulled from /assets/ folder and chunks of data are sent as client makes continuous requests until all chunks have been fetched
	- Thumbnails dynamically generated using thumbSupply + FFMpeg
	- fixed captions are generated for all videos thru a VTT file provided
	- React App fetches video via ID and a video is returned that matches said ID
- Front End

	- When Component is rendered, a fetch request is made to local server which returns video metadata that includes data needed to render correct information about video
